    "text": "This fall I began my PhD journey in the Developmental and Brain Sciences Program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston as a part of the Early Minds Lab. I’m working with my advisors Dr. Zsuzsa Kaldy and Dr. Erik Blaser, researching the development of working memory using pupilometry and eye-tracking methods with children.\nPreviously, I worked in the Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston Children’s hospital on projects investigating the development of executive functioning in US and Bangladeshi children using EEG and fNIRS neuroimaging methods and eye-tracking. I’m interested in the development of early cognitive mechanisms behind memory and attention and how they interact with the environment. My passion lies in methodology, using eye-tracking and neuroimaging methods for a multimodal perspective on cogntion.\nIn my free time I love trying new foods with my partner and traveling as much as we can. I’m also a plant parent to over 50 plant babies!"

I hope to tease apart mechanisms behind memory strategy stability to inform future interventions directed at improving memory abilities."
